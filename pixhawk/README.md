- [MicroXRCE Agent Setup](px4_microxrce_setup.md): get a communication link via ROS2 with Micro-DDS working in the Ethernet port. This receives telemetry in the Raspberry Pi and sends offboard controls to Pixhawk. You will not be able to connect to QGroundControl through this tutorial, except if you use ROSBridge and MAVRos.

- [Raspberry Ethernet Telemetry Setup](raspberry_eth_telem.md): sends telemetry data from Pixhawk to Raspberry via Ethernet port, and from Raspberry to ground station (QGroundControl) via Mavlink-Router.

- [Onboard Uart Telemetry Setup](onBoard_uart_telem.md): sends telemetry data from Pixhawk to Raspberry/Jetson via Uart port (serial connection), and from Raspberry/Jetson to ground station (QGroundControl) via Mavlink-Router.
